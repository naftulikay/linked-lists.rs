# linked-lists.rs [![Build Status][travis.svg]][travis]

My own personal walkthrough of the excellent tutorial, ["Learning Rust with Entirely Too Many Linked Lists."][tutorial]

## Development

`vagrant up` for a fully-functional, contained, batteries-included Vagrant development VM.

## License

MIT.
